# Running this workshop in your personal AWS account

### AWS account

Ensure you have access to an AWS account, and a set of credentials with *Administrator* permissions. **Note:** In a production environment we would recommend locking permissions down to the bare minimum needed to operate the pipeline.

### Deploy the Cloud9 infrastructure

Deploy [workshop/main.yaml](../workshop/main.yaml) via the CloudFormation console. This will setup a new Cloud9 instance for you to to work in. Note that it may take several minutes after the Cloud9 instance is available before it is completely configured.

Continue the rest of the workshop by following the instructions [here](../README.md#Configure-the-AWS-Cloud9-environment)
